/*
The goal of this task is cleaning up trash deposits and preventing relayerâ€™s congestion.

This task should:
- Delete (remove from persistent storage) QUEUED deposits that have been in that state for more than 48 hours.
- Delete (remove from persistent storage) any deposits that are in the FINALIZED state for more than 12 hours.

More info: https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/L2-tBTC-SDK-Relayer-Implementation-4dfedabfcf594c7d8ef80609541cf791?pvs=4
