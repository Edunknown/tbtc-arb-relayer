That will finalize INITIALIZED deposits in the L1BitcoinDepositor contract.

This task should:
- Fetch all INITIALIZED deposits from the persistent storage.
- For each deposit, check if it is already finalized in the L1BitcoinDepositor contract (using the L1BitcoinDepositor.deposits call):
- If not finalized, check finalization possibility (by executing a pre-flight call to L1BitcoinDepositor.finalizeDeposit)
- If finalization is possible, call L1BitcoinDepositor.finalizeDeposit and update the internal deposit’s state to FINALIZED.
- If finalization is not possible, do nothing.
- If already finalized, don’t call the contract and just update the internal deposit’s state to FINALIZED (corner case when deposit was finalized outside the relayer).
